After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
User Interface Overview:
1.After installation head to the settings option and select themes, dark theme is a good preference for programming. Select color theme and search for dark modern.
2.While working on a project you might forget to save, in the files tab tick the autosave option.
For the extensions:

2.Python aids in working on python projects
3.Flutter and dart
4.Webview used when creating websites

Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
1.Activity bar: Found on the left side and gives access to different features including search which assists in looking for files, Explorer for navigating folders, Extensions used to download relevant extensions.
2.Side bar: Found on the immediate right of the activity bar and displays the various views based on the selected activity like Explorer view which shows a tree view of the workspace, Search view that displays search results, Debug view which manages breakpoints, call stacks when debugging and Extensions view that lists installed extensions.
3.Editor group: It is the central area where the code files are opened and edited. It has a tab where each open file is displayed at the top of it, the split view allows splitting the editor into multiple groups to view and edit multiple files side by side, Diff view shows the differences between files for version control purposes
4.Status bar: Found at the bottom of the window and provides information about the current file and the overall state of the editor. Displays details such as file path, line and column number. The programming language used is also displayed here. Errors and alerts are shown here.

Command Palette: It is a versatile tool that allows users to access and execute commands quickly and efficiently

What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
The command palette in VS code can be accessed by using Ctrl + Shift + P in windows or alternatively opening it via the menu through he view then command palette.
It can be used for the following tasks:
1.Opening files: When searching for a saved file it will suggest the available files with the same name.
2.Selecting theme: Under preferences and color theme, a user can change the existing theme and appearance.
3.For extensions: It can be used to run built-in commands and extensions
4.Runs debugging configurations: By typing start debugging, a debugging session begins using the desired configuration.
5.Viewing Git history: Through view file history command, the commit history for the file can be viewed.

Extensions in VS Code:
Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
Extensions in VS Code enhance and expand the functionality of the editor by adding new features, tools and capabilities for specific programming languages.
Through the side bar, the extension view is found and can be accessed or via the Ctrl + Shift + X shortcut key.
The search bar enables the user to find the extension by name, keyword and functionality.
After locating the desired extension, it it has not been installed yet, click on install.
A user can manage extensions:
1.By viewing the installed extensions through the extensions view.
2.Enabling/Disabling the extensions by right clicking on the specific extension to enable or disable it.
3.Updating extensions which are searched for automatically.
4.Removing the extension through the uninstall option.
Examples of essential extensions for web development:
1.Prettier: Formats code automatically to ensure consistency.
2.ESLint: integrates ESLint JavaScript linting into VS code.
3.Live Server: it launches a local development server with live reload capabilities.
4.GitLens: It enhances  Git integration in VS code.
5.Debugger for Chrome: It debugs JavaScript code in the chrome browser.
6.HTML CSS Support: It enhances HTML and CSS support in VS code.

Integrated Terminal: It allows you to run shell commands directly within the editor.

Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
The integrated terminal can be opened by navigating to the menu  then view and select terminal or by using the shortcut Ctrl+
Using the integrated terminal:
1.Basic commands can be run like ls, cd,git and npm.
2.The split terminal allows a user to split the terminal panel to allow viewing of multiple terminal sessions.
3. The shell configuration can be made default through the settings.json command.
4. The existing code can be cleared from the terminal using the clear command. The up and down arrow keys on the keyboard can be used to navigate through the command history.
The advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal
1.There is seamless workflow for the terminal is integrated within the editor so switching between them is easy.
2.Context awareness meaning the terminal opens in the context of your workspace starting in the root directory.
3.Errors and outputs in the terminal can often be clicked to navigate directly to the corresponding line in the code editor.
4.The terminal can be customized to match your development needs from setting default shell to changing its appearance.
5.Some extensions provide terminal commands or output directly within the integrated terminal.

File and Folder Management:
Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

2.Stepping through code
3.Variables and watches
4.Call stack
5.Debug console
6.Integrated terminal
7.Inline values

Using Source Control:

How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Initializing a Git repository
1.Open your project in vs code through file then open folder
2.Initialize a git repository by opening the source control view by clicking the source control icon in the activity bar on the side of the window.
3.Click the initialize repository button and this creates a new git folder in the project.
Making commits
1.In the source control view, there is a list of files that have been changed. Hover over a file and click the  + sign icon next to it to stage the changes.
2.Write a commit message in the commit message box at the top of the source control view, write a brief, descriptive message about the changes you are committing.
3.Click the checkmark icon above the commit message box or press Ctrl + Enter to commit the changes
Pushing changes to github
